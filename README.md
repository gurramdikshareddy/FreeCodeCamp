# ðŸ’» My freeCodeCamp Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **freeCodeCamp** repository! Iâ€™m learning to code and building projects from **freeCodeCampâ€™s** curriculum, and Iâ€™ve decided to share all my completed code here to help others learn, too!

### ðŸŒ± Why Iâ€™m Doing This:
Iâ€™m working through the **freeCodeCamp** challenges to enhance my coding skills. By sharing my code, I hope it helps others who are also learning. Feel free to browse, learn from my solutions, or even contribute!

### ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here:
- **Completed Coding Challenges**: All the challenges Iâ€™ve completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- **Projects**: Fully working projects that Iâ€™ve built as part of the certifications.
